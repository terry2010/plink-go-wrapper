# plink-go-wrapper
simple plink socks5 to ssh proxy wrapper


Started writing and found that this UI library has too many limitations. Many essential features, such as custom controls items and real-time display of traffic data in the system tray icon, are difficult to implement for the desired effect.

Therefore, I've decided to stop working on this project at this point.


So, this project remains in the functional prototype state, currently only featuring the core functionality: launching a local SOCKS forwarding service using plink.exe.
